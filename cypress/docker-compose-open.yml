# run demo app and open Cypress Test Runner inside a Docker container,
# and send the X11 output to the server running on the host machine to see and interact with the tests.
# Most services are configured in the file docker-compose.yml
# This file only overrides variables necessary for visual work with X11. To run:
#
#   docker-compose -f ../app/docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-open.yml run --rm tests
